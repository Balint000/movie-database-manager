* **Sorting:** Movies can be sorted by **Rating**, **Release Year**, or **Title** in both ascending and descending order.
* **Edit (Update):** Allows users to modify details of an existing movie through a dedicated modal.
* **Delete:** Confirms and removes a movie from the list using a confirmation modal.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
